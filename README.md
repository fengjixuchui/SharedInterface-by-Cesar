# :space_invader: Shared Memory Client-by-Cesar :underage:

* This is a Shared Memory Client implementation writen in c# using as base an updated and little improved version o Frankoo's driver, for orginal driver code check his repo.

* There is also an useless "NativeInterface" for studies, fell free to delete it.(deleted)

* This project is more a PoC!!!, there are some stuff missing so implement yourself, this isn't a p2c project.

* Assume this project is flagged, once its public, and code your own shared memory C# client.

* :kissing_smiling_eyes:

## Usage Instructions

* Compile both User Mode/Driver it, and thenâ€¦

1. Run user mode.
2. Run driver.(removed)
3. If its all ok, implement your stuff/methods.

## Troubleshooting

* For errors/issues check if you:
1. Have .NET 4.72 installed
2. Check if [wdk](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk) is installed.
3. Contact me in UC (pm me), or open an issue here.

## Compatibility

* CleanPiddb method is working in (1803/1809), as usermode and driver itself. (11/09/2019)(driver removed)
